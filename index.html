	<h1>Terminology</h1>
	<p>Terms can be interpreted in different ways by different people, below our definition of the two key terms in our visualization.</p>

	<h1>Terrorism</h1>
	<p>Terrorism is committing or threatening others with violence. Terrorism is directed at people or against society. Usually, the goal is to force political change or to sow fear. When we are talking about a personal attack targeted at one individual, this is not terrorism.</p>

	<h1>Terrorist attack</h1>
	<p>These are crimes committed from ideological motives. These are crimes with the aim of social change, to hunt or to influence political decision-making and/or enduce fear onto society. A terrorist attack can consist of a suicide bombing, shootings or other types of attacks.</p>

	<h1>Our sources</h1>
